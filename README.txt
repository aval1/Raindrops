-The catcher moves horizontally with the mouse, remains vertically in place
-The raindrops fall one at a time, every 2 seconds using a timer
-The objective is to avoid the raindrop with the catchee
-If a drop comes into contact with catcher, the drop is sent to an off-screen location, stops moving, and lives decreases by one
-If the player misses a drop with the catcher and it reaches the bottom, it is moved off-screen the score inccrease by one
When the score reaches 10, 30, or 50, the rate in which the raindrop falls, increases.
-If the player loses all 10 lives, the game ends, with the option to replay
-If the player gains a score of 100. they win and will be able to replay


Bugs:

-Game freezes for moments at random intervals
